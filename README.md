# Getting Started with Your React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is hosted on Firebase.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload as you make changes, and you may see lint errors in the console.
  
- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See more details [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).
  
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. This correctly bundles React in production mode, minifying the files and optimizing for the best performance. Your app is ready to be deployed!
